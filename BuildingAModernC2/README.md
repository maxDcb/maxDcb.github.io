# Building a Modern C2 — Introduction to the series

I’m starting a series of technical posts about my Command-and-Control (C2) framework **C2TeamServer** (repo: [https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer](https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer)). Over the next articles I’ll walk through the project end-to-end: the **teamserver architecture and listeners**, the **GUI and operator workflows**, the **implants channels and modules stealth strategies**. This first post is a roadmap: what the project is, why I built it, and what I will present in upcoming posts.

Why write this series?

There’s already a lot of high-level C2 analysis and single-technique PoCs out there. My goal is different: to share an engineered, modular C2 implementation with practical, hands-on explanations and a clear look at the architecture decisions behind it. This series is aimed at practitioners who want to understand not just what works, but why it was built that way.

I started this project after taking the CRTO and experimenting with tools like Cobalt Strike. Coming from a C++ development background, I found it instructive to build a complete C2 stack to better understand the mechanics and tradeoffs. I’ve been developing this in my spare time for about two years; the project is now mature enough that it’s worth summarising my work and moving it to the next level — more structure, clearer docs, and tangible examples that others can learn from or contribute to.

## What is **C2TeamServer** 

**C2TeamServer** is my modular C2 framework. At a high level it consists of:

* **TeamServer** — the central controller that manages listeners, manages sessions, routes messages, and distribute task/output.
* **Listeners** — network endpoints (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB, etc.) that accept inbound connections from implants. Listeners easy to develop, pluggable and configurable.
* **Implants** — agents that connect back to listeners, handles modules to execute tasks (system operation, file transfer, process injection, etc.).
* **GUI** — a desktop interface to interact with the server, visualize active sessions, author tasks, manage droppers and more.
* **Modules** — small, testable components (e.g., file transfer, lateral movement, commands) that will be the action executed by an implant.

The repo is organized to favor **modularity**.

## Audience & prerequisites

This series assumes:

* Intermediate knowledge of systems programming (principaly C/C++).
* Familiarity with Linux/Windows internals (processes, tokens, networking).
* Comfort reading code, running local labs.

## Series roadmap (what to expect)

I’ll break the work into focused posts so each article is deep and thorough.

### Part 1 — TeamServer & Architecture (next post)

* Build system
* Messagerie choices
* Handling of listeners
* Interaction with modules

### Part 2 — Listeners & network design

* How listeners are implemented and why (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, TCP raw, named pipes)

### Part 3 — GUI & operator workflows

* GUI design goals
* Why I choose python with modularity in mind

### Part 4 — Implant design, channels & steal strategies

* Implant architecture
* Channel implementations
* “Steal” strategies

### Part 5 — Modules ?

* I don't know yet

## Want to follow along?

* Star and watch the repo: [https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer](https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer)
* I’ll publish each post to my blog ([https://maxdcb.github.io/](https://maxdcb.github.io/)).

## Wrap up

This series will be practical, code-centric. The next post (TeamServer internals and configuration) will dive into the codebase structure, key modules, and show the TeamServer boot flow.

If there’s a specific angle you want me to prioritize (deep dive on a particular transport, UI automation, or implant persistence mechanics), tell me which one and I’ll fold it into the schedule.

Ready? Here is [Part 1 — TeamServer & Architecture](./Part1TeamServerAndArchitecture.md).
