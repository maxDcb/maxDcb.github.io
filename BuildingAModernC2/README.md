# Building a Modern C2 — Introduction to the series

I’m starting a short series of technical posts about my Command-and-Control (C2) framework **C2TeamServer** (repo: [https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer](https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer)). Over the next articles I’ll walk through the project end-to-end: the **teamserver architecture and listeners**, the **GUI and operator workflows**, the **implants channels and modules stealth strategies**. This first post is a roadmap: what the project is, why I built it, and what I will present in upcoming posts.

## Why write this series?

There’s a lot of high-level C2 analysis out there, and many PoCs that show a single technique. My goal is different: to share an *engineered, modular* C2 implementation with practical explanations. and a detailed look at architecture choices. This series is meant to be technical and hands-on.

## What is **C2TeamServer** 

**C2TeamServer** is my modular C2 framework. At a high level it consists of:

* **TeamServer** — the central controller that manages listeners, manages operator sessions, routes messages, stores task/output history and enforces policy.
* **Listeners** — network endpoints (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB, etc.) that accept inbound connections from implants. Listeners are pluggable and configurable.
* **Implants** — agents that connect back to listeners, handles modules to execute tasks (payload system operation, file transfer, process injection, etc.). Multiple channel implementations are supported.
* **GUI** — a desktop interface to interact with the server, visualize active sessions, author tasks, manage droppers and more.
* **Modules** — small, testable components (e.g., file transfer, lateral movement helpers, simple commands) that will be the action executed by an implant.

The repo is organized to favor **modularity** and **testability**.

## Audience & prerequisites

This series assumes:

* Intermediate to advanced knowledge of systems programming (principaly C/C++).
* Familiarity with Linux/Windows internals (processes, tokens, networking).
* Comfort reading code, running local labs.

## Series roadmap (what to expect)

I’ll break the work into focused posts so each article is concise, deep and actionable.

### Part 1 — TeamServer & Architecture (next post)

* Goals and high-level architecture.
* Messagerie choices.
* Handling of listeners
* Interaction with modules
* What rest to be done - authentication

What you’ll get: diagrams, configuration examples, and a walkthrough of the TeamServer startup and control loop.

### Part 2 — Listeners & network design

* How listeners are implemented and why (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, TCP raw, named pipes).

What you’ll get: ...

### Part 3 — GUI & operator workflows

* GUI design goals: minimal friction, operator safety, and session management.
* Visualizing sessions, uploading modules, task templates and canned post-exploitation flows.
* Logging, multi-operator coordination, and safe task review.
* What rest to be done - ...

What you’ll get: ...

### Part 4 — Implant design, channels & steal strategies

* Implant architecture: scheduling, comms stack, module management.
* Channel implementations.
* “Steal” strategies.

What you’ll get: ...

### Part 5 — ...

## Want to follow along?

* Star and watch the repo: [https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer](https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer)
* I’ll publish each post to my blog ([https://maxdcb.github.io/](https://maxdcb.github.io/)) and link code examples in the repo.

## Wrap up

This series will be practical, code-centric. The next post (TeamServer internals and configuration) will dive into the codebase structure, key modules, and show the TeamServer boot flow and config examples.

If there’s a specific angle you want me to prioritize (deep dive on a particular transport, UI automation, or implant persistence mechanics), tell me which one and I’ll fold it into the schedule.

Ready? Here is (Part 1 — TeamServer & Architecture)[./OpenShiftGrPart1TeamServerAndArchitecture.md].
